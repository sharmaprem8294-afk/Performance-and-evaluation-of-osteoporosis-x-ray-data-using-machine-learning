# Performance-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-x-ray-data-using-machine-learning
This project uses machine learning to analyze X-ray images for the detection of osteoporosis. It involves image preprocessing, feature extraction, and training different models to classify bones as normal or osteoporotic. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other standard metrics.
