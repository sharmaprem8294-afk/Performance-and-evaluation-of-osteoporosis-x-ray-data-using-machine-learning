Osteoporosis Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the performance and evaluation of machine learning models for detecting osteoporosis using X-ray image data. Osteoporosis is a bone disease that reduces bone strength and increases fracture risk, making early diagnosis important.

The project involves preprocessing X-ray images, extracting meaningful features, and training multiple machine learning algorithms to classify bone conditions as osteoporotic or normal. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in medical image analysis and highlights how automated systems can assist in early osteoporosis detection.
